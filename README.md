# Zephyr
Zephyr is a pseudo-apartment rental website created as part of an all-semester long project for the Software Engineering website at SFSU. This project was meant to emulate a teamworking environment, with each student being assigned a position within a team. The site encorporates various components commonly used in already existing real-estate websites such as an account system, uploading and reviewing posts, and a messaging system.
